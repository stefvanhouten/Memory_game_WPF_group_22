# SCRUM

Tuesday and Friday we would meet and started the day with a SCRUM session.

# Summary

For most of the people in our group it was the first time programming in C# and for Awather C# was his very first programming language.
We chose to make memory game using the OOP principal. 
Although this would be harder for Awather, since he just started programming, we believe it would be in his best interest to start OOP as early as possible. 

We made sure that everybody in the group contributed an equal amount, not in quanitity of code but in hours invested in the project. 
Because we all come from different backgrounds there will be a difference in quanitity of code provided. 
However, this doesn't mean that less code equals less time spent. 

Everyone got assigned a class or multiple classes within the project for which they would be responsible. 

- Stef van Houten

Besides our assigned classes we would take turns in helping Awather, learning him the basics, learning him OOP and assigning him small 
homework tasks. The homewerk we assigned to him can be found on Trello.
